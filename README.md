  A storage-agnostic ORM 
</h4>

`TikiDB` is a lightweight and flexible data access abstraction for JavaScript/TypeScript applications, offering strong TypeScript support. <br/>
It supports multiple storage backends and can optionally integrate with any reactive framework.

⚠️ `TikiDB` is still under development, and some breaking changes may occur in the future. While the general usage shouldn't change much, a few aspects are still being reconsidered:

- "Reactive wrappers" will likely wrap the storage directly, rather than the database and collections.
- The `asyncDatabase()` function is expected to be removed in favor of a unified `database()` function.
- The generic TypeScript parameter "IsAsync" (on Database, QueryBuilder, Storage, and Collection) is planned to be removed.

Most of the current issues I'm facing are related to TypeScript's limitations with higher-kinded types. Once I find elegant solutions to work around these, I'll release a stable v1


⚠️ **Limitations for Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
While `TikiDB` is compatible with both client-side and server-side environments, care must be taken when using it in SSR contexts (such as Nuxt or Next.js).
- **Avoid using global or shared database/storage instances on the server**, as this can lead to state leaking between concurrent user requests. Instead, create a fresh storage and database instance per request, or use a properly scoped dependency injection mechanism.
- **Be cautious when using different storage backends** on the client and the server (e.g., `InMemoryStorage` on the server and `IndexedDBStorage` on the client). If the storage contents differ, it can cause **hydration mismatches** or inconsistent initial states.
