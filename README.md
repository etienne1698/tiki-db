  A storage-agnostic ORM 
</h4>

`TikiDB` is a lightweight and flexible data access abstraction for JavaScript/TypeScript applications, offering strong TypeScript support. <br/>
It supports multiple storage backends and can optionally integrate with any reactive framework.

Inspirations for `TikiDB`: <br />
**[RxDB](https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb)** /
**[WatermelonDB](https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB)** /
**[Drizzle ORM](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm)** /
**[Pinia Orm](https://github.com/codedredd/pinia-orm)**

To provide a better alternative, I created TikiDB after analyzing these libraries.

‚ö†Ô∏è `TikiDB` is still under development, and some breaking changes may occur in the future. While the general usage shouldn't change much, a few aspects are still being reconsidered:

- "Reactive wrappers" will likely wrap the storage directly, rather than the database and collections.
- The `asyncDatabase()` function is expected to be removed in favor of a unified `database()` function.
- The generic TypeScript parameter "IsAsync" (on Database, QueryBuilder, Storage, and Collection) is planned to be removed.

Most of the current issues I'm facing are related to TypeScript's limitations with higher-kinded types. Once I find elegant solutions to work around these, I'll release the library as a stable v1.
