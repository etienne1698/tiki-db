---

Prior to releasing a stable v1, the following items need to be completed:

- Complete and thoroughly test the migration plugin.
- Add more field types (object, boolean, date...)
- SyncEngine
- insert/update/remove, in some storage can return usefull informations, these methods should return these information
- queriesManager should realy check if query is concerned by update/remove/insert and it should juste update result if re-run is not needed
- defaultValues on fields should be used

---

⚠️ `TikiDB` is still under development, and some breaking changes may occur in the future. While the general usage shouldn't change much, a few aspects are still being reconsidered:

- The `asyncDatabase()` function is expected to be removed in favor of a unified `database()` function.
- The generic TypeScript parameter "IsAsync" (on Database, QueryBuilder, Storage, and Collection) is planned to be removed.

Most of the current issues I'm facing are related to TypeScript's limitations with higher-kinded types. Once I find elegant solutions to work around these, I'll release a new major version.
