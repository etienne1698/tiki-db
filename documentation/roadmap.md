Prior to releasing a stable v1, the following items need to be completed:

- The dbName properties (in both Model and Field) are not yet used. Add optional support for mapping fields to and from the database during insert, update, and find operations.
- Complete and thoroughly test the migration plugin.
- Add more field types (object, boolean, date...)
- Add indexes support (in model schema and in InMemoryStorage)
- SyncEngine

---

⚠️ `TikiDB` is still under development, and some breaking changes may occur in the future. While the general usage shouldn't change much, a few aspects are still being reconsidered:

- "Reactive wrappers" will likely wrap the storage directly, rather than the database and collections.
- The `asyncDatabase()` function is expected to be removed in favor of a unified `database()` function.
- The generic TypeScript parameter "IsAsync" (on Database, QueryBuilder, Storage, and Collection) is planned to be removed.

Most of the current issues I'm facing are related to TypeScript's limitations with higher-kinded types. Once I find elegant solutions to work around these, I'll release a new major version.
