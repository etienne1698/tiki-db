## Concepts

Tiki-DB is built around a few core concepts:

- **Models**: Define the structure of your data entities
- **Relations**: Define relationships between models
- **CollectionSchemas**: Combine models with their relations

- **Storage**: Where your data is stored (in-memory, indexed-db, etc.)
- **Database**: The main interface for working with your data
- **Collections**: An abstraction (created by the database) to work with CollectionSchemas in the storage
