Here is a feature comparison table of TikiDB with libraries that serve similar purposes. 

These libraries weren't necessarily designed to meet the exact same needs as TikiDB and they are definitely worth a look! I wouldn't have been able to build TikiDB without the inspiration they provided.

I'm not claiming to be an expert on these libraries, and I may have made some mistakes in the table. Feel free to correct me if something seems off!
